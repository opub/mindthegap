For more advanced crypto asset investors who are comfortable trading on digital asset exchanges, there are several platforms that offer “physical” bitcoin short selling on margin. Poloniex, Kraken, GDAX, and Bitfinex are examples of popular exchanges that enable their users to short bitcoin.

Shorting bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges functions in the same way as shorting bitcoin using CFDs — with the key difference being that you receive your profits in BTC as opposed to USD.

If you are a retail investor and do not have an account with a broker that supports CME/CBOE bitcoin futures contracts, you can also easily short bitcoin using an online CFD broker such as eToro, AvaTrade or Plus500.
